            <b>STUART COMER: </b>Documentary films are allegedly about evidence; in your films, the evidence itself often functions as the "crime." For instance, in one of your best-known works, <i>The Girl Chewing Gum</i> [1976], the voice-over narration, the linguistic clues, are completely misleading with respect to the image.
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JOHN SMITH:</b> When I made <i>The Girl Chewing Gum</i>, I became aware of just how powerful the word can be in determining how we understand an image. The film is composed of only two shots, and what you see for the first eleven minutes is just a documentary shot of people on the street in East London in the 1970s. But what you hear is a voice "directing" all of the action that happens, as if it were a fictional movie being filmed.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC: </b>It's now recognized as a crucial precedent for so much work today that is concerned with scrambling the line between fact and fiction. How did you arrive at such an early conception of both narrative and formal subterfuge?
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS: </b>Well, I'm not sure, but when I put the voice-over onto <i>The Girl Chewing Gum</i>, it was a revelation. I became fascinated by just how ambiguous and mutable documentary images can be, and by how powerfully a voice-over can affect the way we see those images, even when we know that the voice-over is fictitious. After I finished school at the RCA in 1977, I was asked to make a thirty-minute documentary for Thames Television, part of a series of six documentaries held together only by the fact that none of the people who made them had made a film for television before.
            <br>
            <br>
            And I thought, "OK, I've been offered the opportunity to make a film that will be screened on mainstream TV, I'm going to make an antidocumentary. I'm going to make a film that actually undermines documentary while at the same time is one." I wanted to work with a subject that would be familiar to viewers, where there would be an expectation about how that subject might be addressed, so I decided to make a film that revolved around living in high-rise housing. At that time in Britain, the utopian vision of social housing in apartment blocks was falling apart, and everyone knew about the issues involved.
        </p>
        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> That was the ostensible subject.
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> Yes, but in fact my main aim was to pull apart ideas about documentary, to expose how documentary "evidence" could be shaped to fit the filmmaker's agenda. I recorded people talking about the places where they lived, and like all of us, they had both positive and negative things to say. I edited the film so that you didn't really have any idea whether it was a good place or a bad place, where people were making what could appear to be contradictory statements about the place, although of course they're not contradictory at all. They're only contradictory in the simplistic terms that a second-rate conventional television documentary would deal in.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> Why did you feel the need to go beyond the structuralist approaches to film and art that held sway at the time?
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> From the beginning, although I was very interested in the ideas around, for want of a better word, structural film or materialist film, I was also always interested in narrative. There was always an element of humor and play in my work. And there was a lot more of that in the American work—Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Owen Land—than there was in the British work.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, for example, when I first saw <i>Snow's Wavelength</i> [1967], that was an incredibly formative moment, to see the narrative elements in that film—something I'd been trying to do myself already, not knowing that other people were working in that way, trying to integrate what were essentially narrative episodes inside a formal structure and to create a tension between these moments of illusion and the constant reference to the fact that we're looking at something that is constructed.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> This element of play in your work allows you to undermine the same rules that you use to structure your films.
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> Oh, absolutely. In every new piece you're creating a new language, and in order to create a language, you have to create rules. So I'm very interested in making work where you set up a framework within which things operate, where the viewer gradually gets to learn the language, gets to anticipate what's going to happen next—and then expectation is thwarted. The rules change. Unpredictable things happen. A new language develops.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> Were you looking at Surrealist film?
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> One of my most magical cinema memories, actually, is of the first time I ever saw a Surrealist film. I went to an all-night screening at the Electric Cinema in Notting Hill Gate when I was about seventeen, and it was wonderful, because I’d never seen a Buñuel film before. I went to sleep in <i>Exterminating</i> Angel and then woke up in <i>Franju's Judex</i>, I think, and then went back to sleep and woke up in <i>Borowczyk's Goto</i>, <i>l'île d'amour</i>. There was this fantastic merging of different things.
            <br>
            <br>
            I only found out later about the story of Breton and the Surrealists going to the cinema at any time during the program, and once they actually started to work out what the narrative was, that was time to leave and move on to the next cinema.

            <b>SC:</b> It’s a great story, because like those kinds of ludic experiences, your work is also undeniably funny.
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> The humor comes out of my interest in how different things have different meanings depending on the context in which they’re presented. An enormous amount of my work, usually through words, makes propositions about images that we objectively know are untrue. But because of the power of language, it's easy for us to imagine the scenario that's being described. So humor comes out of that, I think, where you’re looking at something that's ambiguous and being given an alternative reading for it. It’s not a premeditated strategy at all.
            <br>
            <br>
            That being said, I'm really pleased that the work does have humor, not least because it's important to me to get a reaction to the work. If you make a film that is funny, you get an audible reaction from the audience—you know that people have tuned in.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> It's interesting to go back to another early film like <i>Associations</i> [1975], which is basically a cinematic rebus using magazine images to create visual puns. Although it uses representational advertising images in a Pop manner, they are chained to this linguistic game.
        </p>

        <p class="ans">
            <b>JS:</b> All I can say is that I have always had a penchant for a bad pun, which I can't quite resist. Wordplay is just one way of playing with meaning. I was reassured to find that I was not alone, when I got to see Owen Land's work. I discovered that both of us explore puns to the extreme and squeeze out every last drop of possible meaning from our material.
        </p>

        <p class="ques">
            <b>SC:</b> How did that approach relate to something like <i>The Black Tower</i> [1985–87]?

JS: Well, almost all my work comes out of personal experience, things that I might encounter in everyday life and imagine in a different context. The Black Tower came about because that was a building I could see from the bedroom of the house I moved into in Leytonstone in East London in the early 1980s. At the end of the film, there is a shot across a railway track and a graveyard. You can see the tower in the distance, and that was actually the view from my bedroom window when I moved into this place.

The “narrative” of The Black Tower is about somebody who notices a building. The building follows him around, he keeps seeing it in different places, and it eventually leads to his mental breakdown. But it comes out of that very real and ordinary experience most of us have when we travel in an area where there is a distinctive tall building that pops up in unpredictable places, wherever you might be.

I filmed the tower from as many different positions as I could, and I framed it so that it appeared as though it were in a different place in each of the shots. So, for example, it’s actually in the city, but at one time I see it over some trees, and I frame it so the only other thing you can see around it is trees—suggesting that the tower has gone to the country. I constructed a narrative around the places that these images suggested: One image showed the tower next to a hospital, so I knew my protagonist would get sick. Another showed it behind a high wall, so I decided he would visit a prison. Another showed it looming over a graveyard, so I knew that he had to die. The narrative is a deliberate pastiche of a supernatural short story; the specific details were not important to me. I was more interested in the power of stories generally, how stories can determine the reading of images and how they can transport us to imaginary places.

SC: The Black Tower, then, seems like a bridge between earlier films, like The Girl Chewing Gum, and later projects like “Hotel Diaries” [2001–2007]. One becomes highly aware of the frame as a border between inside and outside, between us and them—there’s a sense of paranoia, even surveillance, that really builds throughout the film.

JS: Yes, The Black Tower is probably the first film where I’m dealing largely with what you don’t see and what’s actually excluded from one’s vision. The film restricts visual information in two different ways. One is through framing: I film in very tight close-up at times, so although you’re looking at a representational image, you’ve got no idea of what it represents, because you’re just looking at a flat color field. So, for example, you might be looking at a clear blue sky. But there’s just a sky-blue surface. Or you might see something that looks exactly like that same surface, and then a teacup gets placed on it, and you realize it’s a kitchen work top of the same color.

The other kind of not-revealing has to do with darkness. For nearly half of The Black Tower, there’s no image on the screen. The image is completely black. I wanted to shift between representation and abstraction so that the black we see on the screen could just be an absence of image. It could just be black film leader. But it could just as easily be a photographic image of a perfectly represented night sky, or the surface of the wall of a black building in the middle of the day in bright sunlight. All of those images would look exactly the same.
