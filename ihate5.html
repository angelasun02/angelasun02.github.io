More than all that, <br>some ground-sound, ground-note, <br>  
sown in us now, that swells in us, all of <b>us, </b>  <br>
echo of love we had, <br>have, for world, for our world,<br>
on which we seem finally mere swarm, <br>mere deluge,
mere matter self-altered to tumult, to noise,<br>
cacophonous blitz of destruction, despoilment,
<br>
din from which every emotion henceforth emerges,
<br>and into which falters, slides, sinks, and subsides:
<br>sigh-sound of lament, of remorse; <br>sob-sound of rue,   
of, still, always, ever sadder and sadder sad joy.
